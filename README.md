# fresh-validation
This was a dashboard/website created to display and validate daily weather forecasts produced by SENES Consultants' in-house weather model known as FReSH.

Python and Bash scripts were used to pull the previous days' weather data from Environment Canada, the corresponding forecast from the model, and format to JSON for display. The data were displayed on a dedicated website hosted on www.senes.ca, which was built using JQuery and the HighCharts graphing package.

## Live Preview
A live version of the dashboard can be found at [jamiefletcher.github.io/fresh-validation](https://jamiefletcher.github.io/fresh-validation/).

## History
While both SENES and FReSH are now gone, some information survives via the Wayback Machine:

* Overview of FReSH from an old marketing blurb: 
  > The FReSH Forecasting System is a state-of-the-science weather modelling system developed by SENES to predict three-dimensional meteorological conditions over a study area, from the surface up to a height of 20 km.
