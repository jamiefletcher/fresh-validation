# fresh-validation
This was a dashboard/website created to display and validate daily weather forecasts produced by SENES Consultants' in-house weather model known as FReSH.

The applicaton ran on a dedicated linux host and was available on www.senes.ca. The frontend was written in HTML/JS using JQuery and HighCharts. The backend was written in Python and Bash, which pulled the previous days' weather data from Environment Canada and the corresponding forecast from the model. 

## Live Preview
A live version of the dashboard can be found at [jamiefletcher.github.io/fresh-validation](https://jamiefletcher.github.io/fresh-validation/).
