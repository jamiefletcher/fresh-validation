This was a dashboard/website created to display and validate daily weather forecasts produced by SENES Consultants' in-house weather model known as FReSH.  While both SENES and FReSH are now gone, some information survives via the Wayback Machine:
* An example output for the validation tool on [May 29, 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20170531164548/http://senes.ca/verif/)
* The old homepage for FReSH on [senes.ca](https://web.archive.org/web/20171103153900/http://senes.ca/weather_ontario_weather_forecast.html)
* Overview of FReSH from an old marketing blurb: 
  > The SENES FReSH Forecasting System is a state-of-the-science weather modelling system developed by SENES in-house to predict/simulate 3-dimensional meteorological conditions over a study area, from the surface up to a height of 20 km.
